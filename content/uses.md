# Uses

Gear I not only own but actually use. (Not affiliate links.)

## Computing

### Devices

- [M4 Macbook Air](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122209)
- [iPad Air (5th gen, 2022)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111887)
- [Kindle Paperwhite (signature edition)](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature/dp/B0C8RR4WN3/)
- [Boox Page](https://shop.boox.com/blogs/news/introducing-page)
- [Boox Palma 2](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2)
- [iPhone SE (3rd gen, 2022)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111866) - cheap, but still much more phone than I need ... and fits nicely in my pants pocket!

### Peripherals

- [LG 32" 4k monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32ud59-b-4k-uhd-led-monitor) Seven years old, still going strong, no desire to replace it &mdash; I'm surprised!)
- [Lofree Flow Lite 84 keyboard](https://www.lofree.co/products/flow-lite84-mechanical-keyboard) - feels good, sounds creamy
- [Logitech MX Master 4 mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-4) - nice, but overkill for me, should have bought the much cheaper [Keychron M6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-m6-wireless-mouse)
- [Creative Pebble USB speakers](https://us.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble)
- Cheap mousepad and wristpad - which keep my hands/wrists from resting on my desk, which sucks the heat from them

## Home Theater

- [Hisense 55" U8 Series 4k TV](https://www.hisense-usa.com/product-page/televisions-55-class-u8-series-miniled-uled-4k-google-tv-55u8qg) - insanely bright, which makes for excellent dynamic range ... so glad I bought this!
- [TCL S55H 2.1 Sound Bar](https://us.tcl.com/products/tcl-s55h-s-class-2-1-channel-sound-bar-with-dolby-atmos-wireless-subwoofer-and-bluetooth-music-streaming) - budget model, but such an improvement! Be sure to get a subwoofer, makes a big difference.
- [Sony X700 4k Blu-ray player](https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/blu-ray-dvd-players/4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-disc-players/p/ubpx700) - I like to study how films and TV shows are made, and blu-rays (especially 4k) are close enough to theater quality to make that possible.

## Furniture

- [LiberNovo Omni office chair](https://libernovo.com/products/libernovo-omni-dynamic-ergonomic-chair?variant=46491891138798) - finally I can sit for hours without pain! Works best with a footrest.
- [Stressless Mayfair recliner](https://shop.stressless.com/en/c/recliners/mayfair) - insanely expensive, but I will be sitting a lot in my golden years and this chair makes that not only possible but enjoyable.
- [Levo G2 Tablet/Book stand](https://levostore.com/products/levo-g2-deluxe) - saw this in a hospital, thought it might spare my aching wrists ... wonderful, I use it for iPad, Kindle, and physical books, like it so much I bought a second one for upstairs.
- [Tempur-Pedic 3" mattress topper](https://www.tempurpedic.com/other-products/tempur-toppers/v/3813/) - not for everyone, but I now sleep without tossing and turning, no pressure points. Also extends the life of my mattress.
- [Nest Easy Breather pillow](https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-easy-breather-pillow) - inherited this from my late wife who never had a chance to use it, didn't think I'd like it ... but I do, a whole lot!
