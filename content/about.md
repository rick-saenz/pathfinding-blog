This is a placeholder for a site I may eventually build, a repository of wisdom I've collected together over the years, together with some candidate wisdom of my own. That site will probably be built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

In the meantime I'm using this as a place to host a few pages I want to point to from elsewhere, primarily the [Now](/now/) and [Uses](/uses/) pages.
