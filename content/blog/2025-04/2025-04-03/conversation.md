A reaction to reading Sherry Turkle's Reclaiming Conversation.

I've used written communication (email) for a very long time.

Some fraught written exchanges:
- Joel at Earth Tools
- Fairfax County discussion
- Emails after publishing Austin documents
- interaction with Centerville pastor
- Don, JoAnn regarding blog post about Mom

Six feet tall and very angry

Some fraught conversations:
- Scott at ETI
- Floyd at TI
- Called on the carpet for my tax email at TI
- about Austin documents
  - DJ
  - Dan Mickool
  - investigating committee

Deliberately skewed toward email for business relationships (Joel, Pete)

Never used written communication with immediate family
