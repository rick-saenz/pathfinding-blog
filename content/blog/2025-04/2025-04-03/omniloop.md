Good example of how a movie captures my attention without immersing me.

Glenn Kenny review.

Another good example: Adolescence.

Stronger example: last season of Breaking Bad, I was totally engaged, couldn't wait for the next episode, but still much of the experience was as a detached observer, noticing aspects of the direction and production and photography and writing. Which may have detracted from a fuller immersion experience, but I think added up to an overall bigger/better experience.
