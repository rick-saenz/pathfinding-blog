I am working on a more elaborate website, also called Pathfinding, which will have a place for journal entries like these (and some of these may end up there). 

But that project is proceeding slowly, in fits and starts. Meanwhile I want to try publishing regular journal entries as a discipline. 

So rather than wait until the full site is ready to publish, I am setting up a bare-bones weblog for now to host the journal entries.
