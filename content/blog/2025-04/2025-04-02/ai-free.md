I am following the latest AI developments with interest, but I have no interest in using the technology itself. For several reasons. Partly because it may easily turn out to be a historic boondoggle. Partly because I worry about my thinking degenerating if I outsource the job to a machine. 

But mostly because it is past my time to adopt a new technology, especially one so different from what came before. I have a smartphone but barely use it, at least in the ways that folks who grew up with them use them. Smartphones barely make intuitive sense to me, AI not at all.

So, whatever I end up doing here or on the full Pathfinding site, AI will not be a part of it.
