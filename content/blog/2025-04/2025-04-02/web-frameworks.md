The full-blown website I'm working on is built with the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/). I like it a lot, and when it was first introduced I spent some time experimenting with it, thinking of what sorts of websites I could use it to build.

When I decided recently to put some real effort into building the Pathfinding website, I looked around for sites that would be good models and stopped in at [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/). And not for the first time, it's a site I've known about for years and admired -- it's gorgeous, and exemplifies a philosophy (digital gardening) that intrigues me. And at least parts of it looked adaptable to my own vague notions. 

More important, Appleton made the entire codebase publicly available. And this version of the website (her third) was built with Astro. So I downloaded her code, began experimenting with it, and decided it would make a good foundation for Pathfinding.

Appleton [does ask](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V3) that people not simply use her code wholesale, only look to it for ideas:

>It's open source to let people poke around and get ideas for their own garden. However, I'd rather you didn't fork it wholesale in order to build your own garden. First because my code is questionable at best, and second because I designed it according to my own aesthetic preferences, and functional needs / desires. Yours won't be the same.

>It's also awkward when I stumble on someone else's website that is an exact expression of my own design taste and identity. Like walking in on someone wearing your clothing. That said, you can do what you like on the web and I'm not going to make a huge fuss about it.

Fair enough. And in fact there is a goodly amount of her site that I want to remove, because (mostly) I don't need it or (sometimes) don't care for it or (occasionally) would rather do certain things a different way.

But I am not a competent enough web developer at this point to use her site strictly as an inspiration for one that I build from scratch. So I have decided to proceed by subtraction, taking her site and removing the parts I don't need and modifying the rest to suit my own needs. 

This is not simple scavenging. I find myself doing a lot of study and experimenting to understand exactly how she built a particular piece before proceeding to remove or modify it. I also sometimes find myself rewriting pieces I want to keep, just to suit my own tastes.

My hope is that the final result, although built on the bones of Appleton's digital garden, will be significantly different from hers, especially in what is visible to visitors. And a site that I hope meets the spirit of her request.
