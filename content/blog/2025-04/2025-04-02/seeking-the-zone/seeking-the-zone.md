Four years into retirement now, and I'm still crafting a pattern for my days that is satisfying and sustainable. Not that I find myself at loose ends, or directionless -- or, more accurately, to the extent I am, I don't find it disturbing or vexing.

This is a good thing, I think. My days aren't often empty, but even when they occasionally are it doesn't bother me -- and that means things are completely open, I can fill my time without worrying what exactly I fill it with, just as long as they hold my attention. I still look to occupy myself productively, but don't need to justify what I do in that way.

But I do try to choose my pursuits, or potential pursuits, based on how they might make things better for me, or others, or the world.

One criterion that's been more on my mind lately is whether an activity allows me to achieve *flow*, at least intermittently. Many things I enjoy don't do that, which doesn't bother me, but flow is a mental state I would like to explore and so I look for pursuits that take me there.

Reading and watching movies and listening to music *could* be among them, but right now I rarely if ever achieve flow through them, and I suspect it may be that I've already dived too deep, that I know and care too much about how they are made. I can be deeply engaged with any of them, but I also find myself detached, spending as much of my attention on the craft that went into the art as the art object itself -- very much enjoying myself, but not immersed. Was I ever? Hard to remember.

Programming has always been able to put me in the zone. Especially debugging. And working on the Astro website has brought me back again and again. I can't yet sustain it for hours on end, and at this time in my life I don't know if that will ever come back. But as I began reworking Maggie Appleton's site I found myself coming back to it again and again during the day, pondering some small issue and then returning to the keyboard when new inspiration came. And sticking with a problem until it was solved, even if it took multiple sessions to get there.

When I first was thinking about what to do in retirement I thought of programming, naturally. It's something I know how to do, *really* well, and could produce useful things. But I eventually ruled it out when I decided that more than enough programming was happening in the world already, and I was ever more uncertain that it was a good thing anyway. There may be good programs to write, but most of the programming world is not aimed at that, and I don't think I want to spend my energy figuring out what if anything would be good at this point.

So I'm delighted to find that reworking this website is doing that for me, reintroducing me to flow. The work is neutral, I think, not intended to do anything but present the content of Pathfinding. Like Maggie Appleton, it's not my plan to create software for other people to use (and I'm not sure I'll even go as far as her, making the code publicly available).

The thing I wish *would* take me into the zone is writing. But for that I still have hope the obstacle is mainly inexperience, rather than too much experience as with the things above. And that is why I keep looking for a way to write regularly and at length. I hope I'll find a routine that helps build my skills to the point where I can stop practicing writing, and just write.
