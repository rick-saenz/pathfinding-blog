I'll be experimenting with styles here. Such as short sentences and paragraphs like these. One of my hopes is to find better, clearer, more fluid ways to present my thoughts.

I'll also allow myself to revisit older entries and rewrite them, sometimes just tweaking, sometimes making extensive changes. 

One of my long-time weaknesses has been a reluctance to rewrite, which not only leaves me with half-formed pieces that could have been better, but pressures me to avoid writing anything that isn't close to fully formed. This is a place where I'd like to try changing that.

So what you read here may not be in its final form, depending on when you read it.
