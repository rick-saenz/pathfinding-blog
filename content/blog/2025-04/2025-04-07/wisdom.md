"Montaigne once wrote, “We can be knowledgeable with other men’s knowledge, but __we can’t be wise with other men’s wisdom__.”" (David Brooks, The Road to Character)

Wisdom can't be gained as head knowledge, but only through direct experience.

You can't communicate wisdom through words ... or at all. You can only point someone towards an experience which may (or may not) result in wisdom for them, and only if they choose to pursue it.
