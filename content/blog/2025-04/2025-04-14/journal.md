From Die Wise: "I recall sometime after his father died the filmmaker Time Wilson describing his own grief to me in this way: 'When my father died it was like the library burned to the ground'. ... What I think he missed most about his father was not what his father knew, but his way of telling what he knew, the sound of his voice and his way with words."

So true! When I treasure someone, it is for what I get from them when we're communicating. Sometimes it's nonverbal, watching them live their life, but mostly it's conversation, and it's often less the content of what they say but just hearing them say it, in the way they say things. I don't know I ever gained much knowledge from, say, my dad when I spent time together with him in the last three years. But I could sit and listen to him endlessly, whatever he had to say, and take great pleasure just from hearing him say it, as well as watching his pleasure in the fact that I was talking to him, taking the time for him, respecting him, putting great weight on the fact that he wanted to tell me something.

And there's the opposite. Most people I don't treasure at all, can hardly find myt way to valuing, exactly because of what they have to say to me -- which is nothing, or even of negative value. I can mostly tolerate it, out of politeness, and a general concern for them as a human being, and I always aspire to be better at it, to find some value in what they say or steer them to a place where they might have something valuable to say, both for me and for them. But most people aren't in a place where they can do that, are self-absorbed and self-pitying and self-aggrandizing, seeing themselves as quite different than they actually are, and it isn't my job to fix them. It's a gift I could give them, maybe, but it's not an obligation, and they are almost never able to accept it anyway, so it's ok to save that energy for loved ones ... especially because it's very very hard, even with them, to say just the right thing at just the right time.
