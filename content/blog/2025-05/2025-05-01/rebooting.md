I started a blog in March 2000, kept it going for nearly twenty-five years, although there were fits and starts toward the end.

Toward the end my posting began to feel *performative*, in the new sense of that word -- crafted to present a persona to an audience. Since that's close to the last thing I want to do, I put the blog on possibly permanent hiatus.

I suppose there's some chance I'll start posting there again. But twenty-five years of blogging created some baggage I'd just as soon not shoulder again -- a readership, though a small one, and a style of writing which although it evolved over time still locks me in its embrace when I write there.

I've thought about giving up blogging altogether. There are more than enough words in the world already. And anything wisdom I have to pass on can be conveyed better by pointing to the sources that helped me along the path.

But I like to write, and blogging was a way to make that a practice. So I'll give it another try, here.

The most important difference between this blog and the old one is anonymity. I won't do a whole lot to hide my identity. But I won't advertise it, or promote my writing here in any way. For now I won't even provide a way of contacting me, though that might change. 

The only ways you could have stumbled across this, I think, is through an internet search or a personal referral. However you found me, though ... welcome!
