As to a topic to write about, my mind turns to ... hygiene. Which has been on my mind for practical reasons, and the thinking has led me to begin experimenting with some fundamental changes in my hygienic practices. Which changes have been working out well, at least for the short time they've been in effect.

The biggest change has been showering. I've stopped. Arranging for a shower while camping has always been difficult for me, as I suppose it is for most people. Paid showers are hard to find, the technology is lacking (feeding LOTS of quarters into a box to get a timed flow of water), the environs are iffy, and in general they are expensive. At least they seem expensive to me -- no doubt the cost is justified, and it's just the instant and constant availability at home which makes me think that $5 or $8, or even an exorbitant $17 for a cushy truck-stop shower, is just too much. Which puts me into a budgeting mindset as I consider the problem -- how often? which day, given my travel schedule? Will I be staying at a hotel somewhere in there?

The issue was especially irritating when I came to Maine, before the start of the camping season, with the few facilities available not open yet. I decided to tough it out longer than usual, using some large disposable bath wipes I had on hand to have a morning sponge bath, until the facilities opened.
