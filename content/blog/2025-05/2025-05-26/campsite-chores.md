Twenty-six days into my long camping trip, twenty days in Maine, Memorial Day 2025. Still wondering whether I'm going to get any significant writing done on this trip, still haven't ruled it out. So far I've had plenty of excuses not to, primarily the not-so-great weather -- mostly it's been cold (lows in the mid-40s, highs in the low 50s) and cloudy, sometimes rainy, and on the few sunny days I've prefered to go somewhere and do or see something. The views here are spectacular at any time, but particularly impressive when the sun is out.

Today, though, is very nice, mostly sunny, high 60s in the shade. I've done some minor chores, laundromat and getting ice just after breakfast, beard trim and haircut after lunch, a bit of straightening out of my supplies. On Friday I bought a nicely sized power bank from REI and aside from a brief test Saturday, today is the first day I've been able to charge it using the solar panels, which is happening now. The phone is also charging, and once those are done I'll probably do the iPad. At some point soon, maybe today, I want to put an inventory of the contents of my various totes onto my phone, to see if that helps when I end up needing something I don't use every day.

I haven't explored much of the area around Seawall since coming to the campground here, again mostly because of the weather, but this afternoon I will at least take the five minute walk to the shore and explore a bit of the seawall. Exploration itself isn't that important to me, more important is staying physically active, at least somewhat. I don't come to places like this to explore, I come just to be in the place, with opportunities to explore being gravy. 

So even though this would be prime time for that, the next few days promise good weather and I am happy to spend this one puttering, and in particular devoting a bit of time to experimenting with writing on this laptop in the wild, i.e. outside. I was worried about glare, expecting that I would need to be seated at the picnic table to write and as a result not able to control the shade. But I am writing this in the camp chair, laptop in my lap, and it is very comfortable. So I move the chair as the shade moves, and glare is not a problem.
